# PACE:Passability and Memory Integrated Exploration for UAVs in Large-scale and Cluttered Environments

We propose PACE, a hierarchical framework designed for high-speed autonomous exploration in large-scale and cluttered environments. The paper has been submitted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L).

We plan to open source after the paper accpeted.
